# Sinatra web application - Money Cashboard.

This was a project that I undertook as part of my development through CodeClan, Scotland's Digital Skills academy. I chose the project from an array of options as my previous work experience was in the financial advice sector as a political lobbyist. 

The challenge was assigned on a Thursday afternoon and the code hand in was the following Wednesday, and it was the first database-driven, dynamic web app that I created. 

Here is the spec:

## MoneyCashboard

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money. You have decided to make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

### MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display a list of all transactions
- Display total amount spent
- Display total amount spent by tag

### Possible Extensions:

- CRUD actions for the transactions
- Show a warning when the total expenditure is over budget (set a hard coded budget first)
- Add a date to the transactions and view total spending by month
- Any other ideas you might come up with

## Outcomes

MC was the first CodeClan project that I undertook, and I was pleased with what I managed to get done in the alloted time. One aspiration for all our projects was to use no JavaScript. I was pleased that I got a working bar chart in pure CSS/HTML which ended up looking great.
